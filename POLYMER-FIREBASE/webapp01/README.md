This is the Polymer / Firebase Tutoral at:

https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/polymer-firebase-pwa/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0

Its the Notes app.
But I think it has some bugs... I had to hack the instructions to get it to work.
The editor is still not displaying the Hint code.
But is does work on Chrome desk top, android and iOS all really well.
Does not work on Safari on iOS


I have this project working at:
